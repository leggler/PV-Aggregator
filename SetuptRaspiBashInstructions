# **Installing PV-Aggregator on a Fresh Raspberry Pi using the install-bash-script**

## **1. Connect to the Raspberry Pi**
If SSH is enabled, connect to your Raspberry Pi:

```bash
ssh MiniPi@<your_raspberry_pi_ip>
```

Replace `<your_raspberry_pi_ip>` with the actual IP address of your Raspberry Pi.

---

## **2. Download and Run the Installation Script**

### **Step 1: Download the script**
```bash
wget https://your-hosted-script-location/install_pv_aggregator.sh -O install_pv_aggregator.sh
```

*(If you prefer, you can manually create the script by copying and pasting the script contents into a file on your Pi.)*

### **Step 2: Make the script executable**
```bash
chmod +x install_pv_aggregator.sh
```

### **Step 3: Run the script**
```bash
sudo ./install_pv_aggregator.sh
```

---

## **3. Wait for the Installation to Complete**
The script will:
âœ… Update your system  
âœ… Install dependencies  
âœ… Set up a Python virtual environment  
âœ… Clone the **PV-Aggregator** repository  
âœ… Create a systemd service for **automatic startup**  
âœ… Enable **read-only mode** (if needed)  

---

## **4. Verify That Everything Works**
Check if the service is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status pv-aggregator
```

It should display `active (running)`. If there are issues, check logs with:

```bash
journalctl -u pv-aggregator -n 50 --no-pager
```

---

## **5. (Optional) Update PV-Aggregator Later**
If you need to update **PV-Aggregator**, run:

```bash
cd /opt/PV-Aggregator/app
git pull origin main
sudo systemctl restart pv-aggregator
```

---

## **ðŸŽ‰ Done!**
Your **PV-Aggregator** should now run **automatically on boot**. ðŸš€

Let me know if you need any refinements!
